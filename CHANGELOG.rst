Changelog
---------

0.7.8
+++++

**Features**

- Add missing ``eAllAttributes()`` method for retriving all
  ``eStructuralFeatures`` that are ``EAttributes``.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix issue with double notification for x..1--x..* opposite references. When a
  relationship with an eOpposite involving a x..1 and a x..* relationship, in
  case the x..1 was set, the x..* opposite update was doing a "double set",
  thus throwing two times the notification.


0.7.7
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Improve ``EClass`` dynamic modifications. The ``__init__`` method of the
  ``EClass`` was responsible for the registration of an 'eternal_listener'
  (a listener that cannot be removed. In case the ``EClass`` instance was
  created using ``__new__`` then using ``__init__`` to set some values in the
  parameter, the listener was registered **after** the set of some values.
  This implies that some modifications (name modification for example)
  couldn't be took into account in the method that sync the python class with
  the ``EClass`` instance.


0.7.6
+++++

**Features**

- Add options support for JSON serialization. Currently, the only JSON
  serialization option that is added is: ``SERIALIZE_DEFAULT_VALUE``. This
  option allows the user to serialize feature values that are equal to the
  default ones.


**Bugfixes**

- Fix bad default value for ``xxxObject`` data types. These data types (e.g:
  ``EIntegerObject``) must have a ``None`` default value as they do not represent
  the Java boxed type, but their **object** version. This fix introduces a real
  difference between boxed types and non-boxed types.


0.7.5
+++++

**Features**

- Add easier way of dynamically add behavior to ``EClass``. This features adds
  the ability to register function to existing dynamic and static ``EClass``.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix missing exception when affecting single element to collection. When a
  single assignement is done on a collection-kind meta-attribute, an exception
  must be raised as the 'attribute' type is, somehow, modified.

**Miscellaneous**

- Improve the ``eResource`` management. This reduces memory footprint, slightly
  improves big model serialization, and avoides 'unsync' objects with their
  resource.

0.7.4
+++++

**Features**

- Add dedicated method for eclass ref serialization in ``JsonResource``. This
  method allows the user to override it if required in order to control a little
  bit the way the JSON will be produced. If the users override this method by
  providing a new implementation, they also should override the eclass resolve
  method. Otherwise, the deserialization of a previously serialized model with
  this new implementation will fail. The two methods to override are the
  following:

  - ``serialize_eclass(self, eclass)``
  - ``resolve_eclass(self, uri_eclass)``

  Note that for the ``resolve_eclass`` method, the use of a cache like
  ``lru_cache`` is often a good idea.

- Remove systematic serialization of ``EClass`` reference in JSON serializer. In
  some cases where the containing feature type is the same than the serialized
  object, the ``eClass`` entry in the JSON resource is not required. This allows
  to reduce the resource size a little bit more.

- Change the ``EEnum`` implementation for default values. The default value of
  an ``EENum`` is computed from the first element in the ``eLiterals``. The
  change of a ``default_value`` is performed by 'reordering' the ``eLiterals``
  list.


**Bugfixes**

- Refactor ``EProxy`` implementation. The new ``EProxy`` implementation get rid
  of the ``EPlaceHolder`` class that was used for bad reasons. Now, an
  ``EProxy`` inherits from an ``EObject``. As a side-effect, this also fixes an
  issue in the JSON serialization: ``EProxy`` were not resolved, and,
  consequently, a ``Resource`` with ``EProxy`` inside was not serializable.

- Remove Ecore metamodel from a Resource. Each metamodel registered in a
  ``ResourceSet`` or the ``global_registry`` should not be part of a
  ``Resource``. The fact that they are registered in a ``Resource`` implies that
  they are part of the same level than the ``Resource`` which is serialized.
  However, they are part of something "greater".

- Add special deserialization method for ``EEnum``. The basic deserialization
  method for ``EEnum`` instance was the same than the one for ``EDataType``.
  They only takes the string and put it in the feature instance. Instead, when
  a string is found for an ``EEnum`` feature, the ``EEnumLiteral`` must be
  searched. This new ``from_string`` implementation just does this.


0.7.3
+++++

**Features**

- Performance improvement for JSON deserialization. The use of the ``lru_cache``
  enables the JSON resource to quickly identify metaclasses once they are
  resolved.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix issue with JSON serializer when multiples subpackages are used. The
  ``eClass`` relationship, serialized in the form of the root ``EPackage`` uri
  with the ``EClass`` uri fragment were badly formed.

- Fix calls in ``XMIResource`` and ``JsonResource`` for ``URI`` handling. This
  new way of calling an ``URI`` input/output stream creation enables a simpler
  creation of new dedicated ``URI``. As example, a ``StringURI`` is added in
  the ``README.rst``.


0.7.2
+++++

**Miscellaneous**

- Change the usage of ``MutableSequence`` for ``UserList`` instead, reducing
  some boilerplate code.
- Add missing ``@staticmethod`` when required.


0.7.0/0.7.1
+++++++++++

**Features**

- Add ``XMLTypes`` implementation. This first implementation relies on
  ``XMLTypes.ecore`` and had been generated using pyecoregen. The generated code
  had been manually modified to deal with some current restriction in PyEcore.
  The result is a slightly modified version of some ``EClass`` defined in the
  xml types metamodel. These modifications does not affect the model layer which
  will work as intended, but can give some false information about some types
  when reflection on the xml types metamodel is used.

- Add very basic EMF Editing Domain implementation. This simple implementation
  allows the user to create/load a resource and to execute/undo/redo commands
  that implies element from a resource contained in the Editing domain's
  ``ResourceSet``. This implementation will evolve by probably adding read only
  resource support and copy/paste functionnality.

- Add basic support for ``OrderedSet``'s' ``__setitem__`` method. This very
  simple implementation relies on ``insert`` and ``pop`` and currently does
  not support ``slices``.

- Add ``__iadd__`` support for collections. This little addition allows you to
  add elements to PyEcore collections using ``+=``. This operator also works
  for single element as right operand.

- Add ``del obj.attr`` support for ``EObject`` attributes/references. The
  support for the ``del`` keywords is only activated on ``EStructuralFeature``
  instances. It allows to clean references on elements for a given object.
  **WARNING:** this action does not delete the pointed object, it only clears
  the reference/collection from the calling element towards the objects.

- Add support for ``dir`` on ``EObject``. The function ``dir()`` now gives a
  sum up of all the attributes/references and operations that can be called on
  an object. This is really handy when PyEcore is handled in the Python console.

- Add ``**kwargs`` support for dynamic ``EClass``. This allows to have more
  fluent constructors. It is important to note that the default behavior when
  a named parameter are used is to set the attribute to the value passed as
  parameter. Also, ``args`` are accepted, but they are not directly handled.

- Add new class decorator for PyEcore metaclass definition. This new decorator:
  ``@EMetaclass``, uses the ``MetaEClass`` metaclass and provides a convenient
  way of defining static EClass. This decorator also reoder the inheritance
  tree so, if the defined class does not inherits from ``EObject``, the
  decorator makes the defined class inhertit from ``EObject``.

-  Add JSON resource serializer. The JSON serializer is able to get an
   ``EObject`` and serialize it in JSON. It can also takes a JSON representation
   of a model, and transform it as an ``EObject``. The JSON format used for
   serialization tries to be closed to the format from the
   `emfjson-jackson <https://github.com/emfjson/emfjson-jackson>`_ project.


**Bugfixes**

- Fix missing ``EDatatypes`` registration in their respective ``EPackage``. The
  data types defined in code generated by pyecoregen was not properly registered
  in their ``EPackage``. The result was a ``None`` value when
  ``datatype.ePackage`` was accessed.

- Fix resource creation if model loading fails for ``ResourceSet``. Even if the
  model loading fails, a resource is created in a ResourceSet. This behavior
  was problematic as two successive loading of the same faulty model lead to a
  failure the first time, but to a success the next time. This commit fixes
  this behavior and adds more tests to detect possible regressions about this.

- Fix load error when metamodel prefix is empty. When a metamodel prefix is
  empty, special tags, with the namespace encoded inside, are created by lxml.
  This was an issue with the xmi loading method as each tag's node was not
  properly decoded.

- Improve OrderedSet ``insert/pop`` methods. The default ``OrderedSet``
  implementation does not provide methods for ``insert`` and ``pop``. The
  current code provided by PyEcore, monkey patching the library, was mixed
  with internal PyEcore code. This new implementation split the two concerns
  and proposes a better way of dealing with these two methods.

- Fix missing ``containement`` attribute for ``eParameters`` relation. This
  missing attribute was reslting in the placement of each ``EParameter`` at
  the root of the model instead of the ``EOperation`` they were linked to.

**Miscellaneous**

- Change ``__repr__`` display for ``EClass`` and ``EStructuralFeature``. The
  fact that PyEcore is extensible and the basic ``EClass/EStructural``
  metaclasses can  be extended requires a better representation.

- Add ``__name__`` attribute on instances of ``EClass`` so they look a little
  bit more like a python class.

- Improve inheritance tree building for static ``EClass``. This new detection
  relies on the fact that an existing EClass already have an ``eClass``
  attribute. This modification will prepare the work for the introduction of a
  new method for generating static ``EClass``.

- Add missing ``super().__init__()`` call in base classes. This missing
  statement could be an issue for multiple inheritance.

- Add better support for ``**kwargs`` in ``EObject`` constructors.

- Improve performance. As attribute are accessed in a lazy-loading way, there
  is no more need for post object creation initialization.


0.6.0
+++++

**Features**

- Add multiplicity parameter for ``EParameter/EOperation`` constructors.
  Parameter and Operations can express a multiplicity like ``1..*`` if wanted.
  This attribute can be modified after one of these object had been created,
  but it wasn't possible to give the multiplicity during the object creation.
  This commit simply add the missing parameters in the constructors.

- Add new way of dealing with ``isinstance``. The ``isinstance`` method from
  the ``EcoreUtils`` class was not very effective and was gathering all cases
  in a big ``if/elif/else`` block. This commit defers all the ``isinstance``
  to a method ``__isinstance__``, implemented in each required elements. This
  commit also introduce a new way of init for each ``EStructuralFeature``
  attributes when an instance is created.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix intra-document references by proxy. A reference between elements can also
  be done using a 'full' URI, i.e: specifying the uri/path of the resource to
  access and the path towards the object. This way of referencing elements is
  not reserved to metamodel references, but can be done with any kind of
  references. To deal with this, a proxy is introduced each time such a
  reference is done. This allows to relies on the same mechanism as the href
  one and gives a better control over their resolutions.

- Fix ``ResourceSet`` local resource resolving. When a local resource is searched,
  the path and its uri is split. Once the uri is split, its path is searched in
  the 'resources' of the ``ResourceSet``. This search was done in a 'file' like only
  researched, while the uri could be a logical one (for the ``plateform:/``
  like uri).

- Fix missing ``name`` feature validation. The name feature was only handled as
  a simple python attribute instead of an EAttribute. This time, the ``name``
  feature is handled as an ``EAttribute``. As each instance of ``EAttribute``
  needs to use its own name (which is an ``EAttribute``), it is required to cut
  the recursive call. To do so, the ``EStructuralFeature`` listen to each
  changes performed on itself. If a modification occurs on the ``name`` feature,
  it keeps a simple python attribute version which can be used in the
  ``EStructuralFeature`` descriptor.


0.5.11
++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Add missing ``iD`` feature for ``EAttribute``. In EMF, the ``iD`` feature can
  be se for ``EAttribute``. This attribute was missing from the pyecore
  metamodel. This new version also adds the ``iD`` keyword for the
  ``EAttribute`` constructor.

- Add missing basic ``EDataType``. The added ``EDataTypes`` are:
    * ``EDate``,
    * ``EBigDecimal``,
    * ``EBooleanObject``,
    * ``ELongObject``,
    * ``EByte``,
    * ``EByteObject``,
    * ``EByteArray``,
    * ``EChar``,
    * ``ECharacterObject``,
    * ``EShort``,
    * ``EJavaClass``.


0.5.9/0.5.10
++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix decoding issue when HttpURI with http-href is used. When a href is used,
  the ResourceSet resolver tries to concatenate the path built from the main uri
  resource and the href uri fragment. In the case of HttpURI, the concatenation
  provided a 'http://abc/http://cde' like uri. The ``normalize()`` method of URI
  was spliting on '://' and used unpacking to two vars exactly. With this kind
  of uri, it resulted in an exception. This commit fixes this issue using simply
  the ``maxsplit`` option from the ``split()`` method.

- Fix issue when ``name`` feature was called as part of descriptor. This error was
  simple, the ``name`` feature defined as a static meta-attribute of the
  ``ENamedElement`` metaclass was overriding the property implementation in the
  ``EStructuralFeature``. This issue was also preventing from properly monkey
  patching pyecore for ``name`` access.

0.5.8
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix issue when multiple undo/redo are performed. Each time an undo is
  performed, the command stack top pointer is decremented. It only points to the
  command before the last one. Obviously, each time a redo is performed, the
  command stack needs to be incremented, and it points to the previously undone
  command. The 'redo' method was missing the top stack incrementation.


0.5.7
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix default value for ``EAttribute``. ``EAttribute`` let the ability to express
  default values. This value is assigned when an ``EClass`` instance is created.
  The ``default_value`` is computed as follow: if the ``EAttribute``'s
  ``default_value`` is set, this ``default_value`` is returned. If the
  default_value of the ``Eattribute`` is not set, then the ``default_value`` of
  the ``EAttribute`` associated EDataType is set. This way of computing elements
  was not properly used during instance initialization.

**Miscellaneous**

- Fix some examples in the ``README.rst``.

0.5.6
+++++

**Features**

- Add missing ``EDataType`` management in the Acceleo generator.


**Miscellaneous**

- Add missing data type conversion for ``EDataType``.
- Fix once and for all the ``setup.py`` (hopefully).

0.5.5
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix ``__update()`` method in ``EClass`` when many elements are added at once.
  This case occurs when ``append()`` is used on an ``EClass`` in order to add
  many ``EStructuralFeature``.

- Fix shared content for mutable ``EDataType``. When mutable EDatataypes are
  defined (e.g: ``EStringToStringMapEntry``), each default value was pointing to
  the same shared value (exactly the same thing that when ``def x(self, n={})``).
  The default_value is now computed, if a special attribute is set, the default
  value is always created as a new empty value.

- Fix default value for property instances accessed after the instance creation.


**Miscellaneous**

- Add missing ``EFeatureMapEntry``.
- Add missing LICENCE file in dist package.
- Add default value managmeent for 'instanceClass' derived datatypes.

0.5.0
+++++

**Features**

- Add new static metamodel generator (`@moltob <https://github.com/moltob>`_
  contribution, thanks!). The generator, named `pyecoregen <https://github.com/pyecore/pyecoregen>`_,
  is written in full Python/Jinja2 using `pymultigen <https://github.com/moltob/pymultigen>`_ a
  framework for multiple files generation. The generator usage is prefered over
  the MTL/Acceleo one as it can be launched from the command line directly and
  does not requires Java or Java-dependencies to run. The generated code is
  also automatically formatted using the ``autopep8`` project.

- Add EMF command support. The EMF command support gives the ability to represent
  actions that modify the model as single or composed modification command. There
  is 5 existing commands:
  * Set,
  * Add,
  * Remove,
  * Delete,
  * Compound.

  Each command affects the model in a certain way. The main advantage of using
  commands over direct modification is the fact that each of these commands can
  be undo/redo.

- Add Command Stack support. The Command stack gives the ability to easily schedule
  the execution of each commands. It also gives a simpler access to the undo/redo
  function of each commands and ensure that they are played/re-played in the
  right order.


**Bugfixes**

- Fix handling of 'non-required' parameters for ``EOperations``. When a
  parameter is set as 'non-required', the Python translation must consider that
  the parameter is defined as an optional named parameter.

- Fix issue with the computation of some internal properties for the ``delete()``
  method (the ``_inverse_rels`` set). The current algorithm keep track of each
  inverse relationships, and when an element is removed, the old record is
  deleted while a new one is added to the record set. The bug was affecting the
  registration of the new record during the deletion of the old one.

- Fix ``__update()`` method in ``EClass`` when an object deletion occurs. The
  update method deals with notifications to add/remove elements on the fly from
  the listened notification. When a REMOVE was notified, the wrong notification
  property was accessed resulting in a ``NoneTypeError`` exception.


**Miscellaneous**

- Add ``getEAnnotation()`` method on ``EModelElement``.
- Change 'getargspec' by 'getfullargspec' as it seems that 'getargspec' is
  deprecated since Python 3.0 and replaced by 'getfullargspec'.
- Add some performance improvements.
- Add missing ``pop()`` operation for ``EList/EBag``.
- Monkey patch ``insert()/pop()`` methods in ``OrderedSet``.
- Add missing ``@staticmethod`` when required.
- Add missing ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` to the meta-instance creation in
  ``EClass``. This addition allows the user to create it's own '__init__' method
  for dynamic metaclasses using some trickery.


0.3.0
+++++

**Features**

- Add new class to ease dynamic metamodel handling. The dynamic metamodel
  manipulation is a little bit cumbersome when it comes to extract all the
  existing EClass from a loaded EPackage. A new class is provided:
  'DynamicEPackage' which constructs, using reflection, an object that has
  direct references to each EClass/sub-EPackage by name. This greatly helps the
  user to easily call and get EClass from a freshly loaded dynamic EPackage.


**Bugfixes**

- Fix missing double notification raised for eopposite references. When an
  eopposite reference were set, the notification system were called three times:
  one for the main feature (the feature on which the add/remove/set/unset have
  been made by the user) and two for the eopposite. The first eopposite
  notification were normal, but the second one was a residual notification sent
  by the algorithm. This new commit simply removes the extra-notifications and
  adds new tests to detect these issues.


**Miscellaneous**

- Add better semantic differentiation for ``EBag`` and ``ESet`` collections.
- Add slicing support for ``EList``.
- Add missing ``ordered`` and ``unique`` parameters for ``EAttribute``.


0.2.0
+++++

**Features**

- Add new static metamodel code generator (@moltob contribution, thanks!). The
  new generator gives more flexibility to the user as it allows the direct
  assignment of attributes/references values from the constructor. The feature
  reduces the amount of LOC required to create a fully initialized instance and
  also helps for the instance creation as IDE smart-completion feature can
  propose the attributes/references to the user.

**Miscellaneous**

- Fix some PEP8/Pylint refactoring and docstrings.
- Small performance improvement in the ``EcoreUtils.isinstance``.


0.1.5
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix missing types from Ecore (@moltob contribution, thanks!). These types are
  the `E*Object` types for numbers. The modification had been done in the
  ``ecore.py`` file as these are default Ecore types and not XML types (or
  coming from another EMF lib). This commit increases the compatibility with
  existing ``.ecore`` files.


0.1.4
+++++

**Features**

- Add support for object deletion in PyEcore. The delete feature allows the user
  to remove parts of the model. Those parts can be a simple element or a sub-graph
  if a container object is deleted. The delete tries to keep up to date a special
  list that gathers the non-inverse navigable relation. When called, the method
  gathers all the EReferences of the object to delete and these special relations.
  It then update the pointed references. There is a special behavior if the object
  to delete is a proxy. If unresolved, the proxy can only be removed from the
  main location, but not from the remote one. If resolved, the proxy keep the
  classical behavior. This behavior tries to match the EMF-Java one: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/127567/

**Bugfixes**

- Fix double resources loading in same ``ResourceSet``. When two ``get_resource(...)``
  call with the same URI as parameter were done in the same ``ResourceSet``,
  two different resources were returned. The new behavior ensure that once the
  resource had been loaded, a second call to ``get_resource(...)`` with the
  same URI will return the resource created in the first place.

**Miscellaneous**

- Make use of ``ChainMap`` for ``global_registry`` management (simplify code).
- Raise a better exception when a 'broken' proxy is resolved.
- Add small performances improvement.


0.1.3
+++++

**Features**

- Add support for object proxies. The PyEcore proxy works a little bit differently from the Java EMF proxy, once
  the proxy is resolved, the proxy is not removed but is used a a transparent
  proxy (at the moment) and is not an issue anymore for type checking. Proxies are
  used for cross-document references.

- Remove resource-less objects from XMI serialization. This is a first step
  towards objects removal. The added behavior allows the user to "remove"
  elements in a way. If an element is not contained in a resource anymore, the
  reference towards the object is not serialized. This way, anytime an object is
  removed from a container and let 'in the void', XMI serialization will get rid
  of it. However, this new addition requires that the Ecore metamodel is always
  loaded in the global_registry (in case someone wants to serialize ecore files)
  as a metamodel can references basic types (EString, EBoolean) which are
  basically not contained in a resource.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix bug on EStructuralFeature owner assignment when EClass is updated.

0.1.2
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Only the default ``to_string`` method on EDataType was called, even if a new
  one was passed as parameter. The issue was a simple typo in the ``__init__``
  method.

- The EBoolean EDataType was missing a dedicated ``to_string`` method. This
  issue introduced a 'desync' between XMI that EMF Java can read and PyEcore.
  In cas of EBoolean, the serialized value was either ``True`` or ``False``
  which is not understood by Java (only ``true`` or ``false``, lower case).


0.1.1
+++++

**Features**

- Improved performances on big files deserialization (2x faster). This new
  version relies on descriptor instead of ``__getattribute__/__setattr__``.
  The code is not more compact, but more clear and split.

- New static metamodel generator, producing code related to this new version.

- Add XML type transtyping in the static metamodel generator.


**Bugfixes**

- When an ``eOpposite`` feature was set on an element, the actual opposite
  reference ``eOpposite`` was not updated.

- Subpackages managements for the static metamodel generator. The
  ``eSubpackages`` and ``eSuperPackage`` variables were not placed in the
  package, but in the module.


**Miscellaneous**

- Update bad examples in the README.rst


0.0.10-3
++++++++

**Project State**

- First full working version
