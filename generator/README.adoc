= Ecore to PyEcore Generator

This directory contains the Ecore2PyEcore generator which is a direct generator
from `.ecore` files to a static PyEcore metamodel definition.

The generator is provided as a single MTL (Acceleo) script that can be run in
Eclipse. It has been written and developed in GenMyModel which can be used for
the `.ecore` metamodel definition and the static PyEcore code generation.
